# SamplingProKit by Hot Dogtor Studios

SamplingProKit is a free and open-source repository with all the tools you need to create a Kontakt and DecentSampler virtual instruments.

This template has MICROSHIMMER (FREE EDITION), an instrument I've created sampling a preset from a Korg microKorg. If you have the samples, you can create [Kontakt](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/samplers/kontakt-7/) and [DecentSampler](https://www.decentsamples.com/product/decent-sampler-plugin/) instruments very quickly, without spending an eternity reading the documentation (specialy Kontakt). The learning curve is high, even for software developers.

### Features:
- Real knobs, faders and buttons images (check [WebKnobMan](https://www.g200kg.com/en/webknobman/gallery.php))
- Amp Envelopes: Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release
- Filter cutoff and resonance
- Saturation
- Effects with multiple controls: Chorus, Tremolo, Reverb and Delay
- Switch between monophony and polyphony (one or multiple simultanious voices)
- Switch between fixed or dynamic velocity (note dynamics)
- Glide
- Transpose
- Mix blend between groups of samples
- Advanced arpegiattor (Kontakt only)

### Requirements:
* [Native Instruments Kontakt](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/samplers/kontakt-7/)
* [DecentSampler](https://www.decentsamples.com/product/decent-sampler-plugin/)

## Getting started
This instrument (MICROSHIMMER) has two groups of samples, one with the dry sound and the other with a shimmer reverb effect. The Shimmer knob is a mix blend between this two groups of samples. This is mapped to be used by the mod-wheel of the keyboards.

You need to replace the samples, name of the instrument and the path for the samples on some files.

With SamplingProKit, all the most used controls on a virtual instrument are already created, so maybe you need to remove some code to make simplier instruments. Try finding a variable from a feature you don't want in your instrument (like chorus effect), and remove all the code with that uses this variable (proceed with caution).

### Kontakt
Kontakt works with a scripting language called KSP. I strongly recomend you to keep a open tab for the [documentation](https://www.native-instruments.com/ni-tech-manuals/ksp-manual/en/welcome-to-ksp).

### DecentSampler
DecentSampler design and logic works with XML documents. It's much easier than Kontakt but it's a simplier sampler too.
