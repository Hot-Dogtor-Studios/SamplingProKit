# SamplingProKit by Hot Dogtor Studios

SamplingProKit is a free and open-source repository with all the tools you need to create a Kontakt and DecentSampler virtual instruments.

This template has MICROSHIMMER (FREE EDITION), an instrument I've created sampling a preset from a Korg microKorg. If you have the samples, you can create [Kontakt](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/samplers/kontakt-7/) and [DecentSampler](https://www.decentsamples.com/product/decent-sampler-plugin/) instruments very quickly, without spending an eternity reading the documentation.

![Alt MICROSHIMMER Kontakt](/img/kontakt_instrument.jpg "MICROSHIMMER Kontakt")
<sub>Kontakt 7 Version</sub>

<sub>DecentSampler Version</sub>


## Getting started
This instrument has two groups of samples, one with the dry sound and the other with a Shimmer Reverb effect from a Fractal Audio FM3. The SHIMMER knob is a mix blend between this two groups of samples. This knob is mapped to the Modulation Wheel of the keyboards (MIDI CC 1).

You will need to replace the samples, name of the instrument and the path of the samples on some files.

With SamplingProKit, the most used controls on a virtual instrument are already created, so maybe you need to remove some code to make simplier instruments. Try finding a variable from a feature you don't want in your instrument (like chorus effect), and remove all the code with that uses this variable (proceed with caution).

### Kontakt
Kontakt is a paid software works with a scripting language called KSP. I strongly recomend you to keep a open tab for the [documentation](https://www.native-instruments.com/ni-tech-manuals/ksp-manual/en/welcome-to-ksp).

### DecentSampler
DecentSampler is a FREE software! Design and logic is made with XML documents. It's much easier than Kontakt but it's a simplier sampler too. It's the best place to start you sampling journey.

## Support
The Kontakt scripts include some code by Mario Kruselj a.k.a. EvilDragon. He made the "Arpeggiator (Sync)" script from Kontakt 7 factory presets. He's an excellent developer and helps many KSP developers on https://vi-control.net/.
