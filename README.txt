## Using the instrument

MICROSHIMMER is an instrument I've created sampling a great sounding preset from a Korg microKorg.
This instrument has two groups of samples, one with the dry sound and the other with a Shimmer Reverb effect from a Fractal Audio FM3. 
The SHIMMER knob is a mix blend between this two groups of samples. This knob is mapped to the Modulation Wheel of the keyboards (MIDI CC 1).
